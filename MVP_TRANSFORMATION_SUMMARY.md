./setup.sh

# 2. Start all services
./start-dev.sh

# 3. Test the MVP
node test-mvp.js
```

### **Manual Setup**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install
cd Server && npm install && cd ..

# 2. Setup environment
cp env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration

# 3. Start services
# Terminal 1: Start Ganache
ganache-cli --port 7545

# Terminal 2: Deploy contracts
truffle migrate --network development

# Terminal 3: Start backend
cd Server && npm run dev

# Terminal 4: Start frontend
npm start
```

## 🔧 Configuration Required

### **Environment Variables (.env)**
```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/ardhi-registries

# JWT Secret (change in production)
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key

# Email Configuration
EMAIL=admin@ardhi-registries.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-email-password

# Blockchain
ETHEREUM_RPC_URL=http://localhost:7545
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x... # Deployed contract address
```

## 🧪 Testing the MVP

The project includes a comprehensive test script that validates:

1. **Web3 Connection** - Ganache connectivity
2. **Smart Contract Deployment** - Contract deployment and initialization
3. **Backend API** - Health checks and endpoints
4. **User Registration** - Database and blockchain registration
5. **Authentication** - Login and JWT token validation
6. **Land Registration** - Property registration workflow
7. **Government Approval** - Approval/rejection process
8. **Land Trading** - Purchase and ownership transfer

Run tests with:
```bash
node test-mvp.js
```

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

The MVP is now ready for deployment with:
